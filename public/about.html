<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a designer with a strong focus on web development. My background is in
  UX/UI, but I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and learning how to
  make digital experiences both functional and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
  Through this project, I wanted to push myself beyond design and dive into
  front-end development. It gave me the chance to understand how design
  decisions translate into structure, interactivity, and usability in a real
  product.
</p>

<p>
  I’m still learning and experimenting, but I see coding as an extension of my
  design practice. My goal is to keep improving my development skills while
  continuing to create thoughtful, user-centered solutions.
